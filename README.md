A small Python 3 editor for learning and competitive programming.

### Why expressPython?
I built expressPython to scratch an itch that I had. I wanted a tool that does following for me.

* Runs easily in windows, portable, doesn't affect system.
* I wanted a tool to test regexes, small scripts.
* Online IDEs **cannot access my file system** I need to access files If I wanted to.
* Online IDEs are sometimes slow at peak times or for non premium uses.
* You cannot access Online IDEs once you are in the underground train ðŸš„.
* It should start fast and I don't need to create files to test things
* Suitable to simulate HackerRank . (Has an input window and output window, works with stdin)
* I wanted to learn C++/Qt and polish Python knowledge.
* Compiled to 32bit will work on a 64bit machine.
* Type some text in to `input` section and process it using quick scripts.

### Contributors

* Bhathiya Perera (JaDogg) - Maintainer and original author

# User Guide

## Installation
This is fairly simple to use. 
* Download a standalone version from the releases. (Currently only Windows binaries available)
* Scan the binary package for viruses if you want âœ”. 
* Extract it using 7-zip or a similar software and run `expressPython.exe`.

## Editor
* Tabs are replaced by 4 spaces.
* Any `\t` (tab) character is highlighted in red.
* There are basic auto-complete features. Use: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>
* Content in the **input** can be read using `input()`
* You can write to **output** using `print()`
* This is not a full IDE and is not planning to be.

## Known Limitations
* Using `time.sleep()` in your code will make it impossible to retrieve output.
* Lacks keyboard shortcuts.

## Credits
Standing on the shoulders of the giants.

* Qt 5.9.x (Or newer is used)
* Python 3.7.x
* Jedi (latest) - https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi
* Frankie Simon's Python Syntax Highlight Code (Modified)
* Mateusz Loskot's Embedding Code (Modified)
* Train Icon from https://www.awicons.com
* All Other Icons from Open Icon Library

# Compiling
This project uses `QMake` to build.

#### Dependencies
* Python 3.7.x (32bit)
* Qt 5.9.x (GPL Version, MinGW 32bit)
>64Bit versions should also work. But it is not tested yet.

Easiest way to compile is to use **QtCreator** and to build the binary.

#### Environment Variables
* `PYTHON37_LOCATION` - On windows set this to parent of `python.exe` of a 32bit Python 3.7 installation.
* `PYTHON37_LIB_LOCATION` and `PYTHON37_INC_LOCATION` should be set to lib and include paths.


# Editor API
You can safely ignore this section if you are not interested in customizing/developing.

## Documentation
```python
# IDE's API
# ---------------------------
from express_api import get_input, set_input
from express_api import get_output, set_output
from express_api import get_code, set_code
from express_api import write_output, get_apppath
from express_api import set_search_regex, interrupt_requested
#
# get method's have no parameters and others have one
#
# get_input   - get input textbox's text
# set_input   - set input textbox's text
# get_output  - get output textbox's text
# set_output  - get output textbox's text
# get_code    - get code textbox's text
# set_code    - set code textbox's text
# write_output- append to output box
# get_apppath - get exe path
# interrupt_requested - returns 1 if we need to stop running

# API Help/Code Sample
# ---------------------------

# get text from input box
# parameters - none
txt = get_input()

# change output box's text
# parameters - string
set_output("")

# append to output box
# does not add a new line
# parameters - string
write_output("Hi You,\n")

# get_apppath() -> get exe path
print("expressPython.exe is at :", get_apppath())
```

## Customising launch script
If you want to customize how your code is executed.
* Copy `ep_runner.py` to `_express_startup_.py` near expressPython binary.
* Edit `_express_startup_.py` as you see fit.
